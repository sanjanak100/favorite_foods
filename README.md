# Getting started with GitHub

Follow these instructions to make sure you know how to fork, clone, commit, and push!

- Click "Fork" above to make a copy of this repository in your own GitHub account
- Navigate to the repository and click the big green "Code" button. Copy the URL presented (it should look something like https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/favorite_foods.git).
- In your terminal, run `git clone URL_YOU_COPIED`. This will copy the repository into its own folder on your local machine.
- Open this README.md file in VSCode. Type in your favorite food below!
- Once you have edited the file, type `git commit -m` in your terminal, followed by a short, descriptive message describing the changes you made (e.g., `git commit -m "Added favorite food"`). This commit command saves a checkpoint of the changes you've made, allowing you to revisit that version later.
- After typing the `git commit` command, type `git push` to publish the changes to your GitHub repository.
